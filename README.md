# Gif-Notifications
An iOS app to send GIF files as Notifications to the user.

When the user presses the "send notification" button, a notification containing a random gif will be sent
after a delay of 4 seconds. 
The user will not be able to view the notification if the application is in the foreground. 
The notification will only appear if the application is in the background.

Each time the user presses the "send notification button", a gif will be selected randomly and will be sent as a notification.
